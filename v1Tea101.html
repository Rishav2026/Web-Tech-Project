            <td> <strong>What is Herbal tea?</strong></td>
            <td>From elegant and soothing to crisp and refreshing, herbal teas are versatile in taste and in experience. The process of making herbal tea begins with a delicate infusion of flowers, fruits, bark, leaves, seeds, or roots in hot water. Herbal teas are often called tisanes, herbals, or infusions, and are known for their delicious and naturally caffeine-free flavors. If you read our Matcha 101 series, you’ll remember that green, black, oolong, and delicious white teas, all of which are caffeinated, are made from the tea plant known as Camellia sinensis. Herbal teas, however, can come from hundreds of plants worldwide, but they do not come from the tea plant.</td>

            <td><strong>Herbal Tea Uses</strong></td>
            <td>Since the time of ancient China and Egypt, herbal teas have been enjoyed not only for their taste – but for their healing properties as well. They were also considered helpful in spiritual and intellectual endeavors. Today, herbal tea is enjoyed mostly as a naturally caffeine-free alternative to regular teas, with varying benefits such as antioxidants, flavors that can help curb cravings, and anti-inflammatory properties.</td>
